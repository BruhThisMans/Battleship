# Battleship
This is my very first personal project using Python. This project was a huge learning experience. If you experience any issues please let me know so I can fix it. 

Main Learning Takeaways:
-I did not utilize the git repository as consistently as I should've. I need to start making commits after segments of code are complete rather than random chunks.
-I learned to have patience because debugging often takes hours depending on the issue. With more experience though, debugging will eventually take less time.
-It is important to have breaks between writing code. If I do no take breaks often then my thinking process will be scewed. I spent a good two to three hours one night trying 
to fix my winning condition. I decided to go to sleep and I woke up the next morning with correct solution and implemented it quickly. Our brains need rest!
