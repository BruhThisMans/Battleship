# Battleship
This is my very first personal project using Python. This project was a huge learning experience. If you experience any issues please let me know so I can fix it. 

Main Learning Takeaways:
1. I did not utilize the git repository as consistently as I should've. I need to start making commits after segments of code are complete rather than random chunks.
2. I learned to have patience because debugging often takes hours depending on the issue. With more experience though, debugging will eventually take less time.
3. It is important to have breaks between writing code. If I do no take breaks often then my thinking process will be scewed. I spent a good two to three hours one night trying 
to fix my winning condition. I decided to go to sleep and I woke up the next morning with correct solution and implemented it quickly. Our brains need rest!
